# PDF2Audio

### Add a pdf and listen to your readings instead.

Here I have a small growing work in progress. The task of this project is to impact students that have busy lives or
help end users listen to enjoy their content where ever they are.

## Use cases pdf adaptation for audio read back

The first case is to make a site that can retrieve pdf format and read the text into a string
that can be inputted into a voice configuration object.

*Web Speech API using speechSynthesis*

**Subject to change API for text to speech cabailities.**
